SUBMISSION  : REFLECTION: WORKSHOP 2 PART 2
DECLARATION : ALL THE BELOW WRITINGS ARE COMPLETELY MY WORDS
              WHICH DESCRIBES EVERYTHING I HAVE LEARNED IN THIS
              WORKSHOP.

First things first, I learned how and why to allocate dynamic
memory in the program. The main reason for using dynamic memory
according to me is that we use many variables in our program,
the value of which is dependent on the user input. Therefore,
at the time of compiling the program, there is no certain
requirement of memory space. Hence. in such cases we use dynamic
memory for those kinds of variables. Further, I also learned 
the importance of deallocating the dynamic memory. While working
on part one of the workshop, I faced the problem of memory leak.
On examining precisely, I discovered that I forgot to close the
file. This indicates the importance of deallocating dynamic
memory and closing the files which were opened. Moving forward
to the second part of the workshop, I realized the importance
of dividing the whole program into several tiny functions. It
not only helps to eliminate the repetation of code, but also
improves the readability of the program and clears the logic
due to which debugging becomes smooth. Overall, I learned the
concept of Memory Management and dividing the program in
functions.
