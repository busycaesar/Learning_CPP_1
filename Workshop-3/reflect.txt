TOPICS WHICH I LEARNED IN THIS WORKSHOP:

==> Creating a class
==> Declaring an object of a class
==> The importance of private and public functions in a class
==> Manipulation of the member variables of the class using function
    members of the class.
==> Setting Empty State of the class variables.
==> Verifing if the client code provides the valid arguments or not.
==> Utilizing the variables and member function of the class by
    creating an object of that class.
==> How to use several functions of cout object(ostream class), in
    order to set precision of the following float value to be printed,
    its alingment, width and filling.

Other than this, I did not faced any significant problem in this workshop
which is worth mentioning. Just some Logical Error were there.
