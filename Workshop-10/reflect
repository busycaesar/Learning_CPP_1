In this workshop, the primary topic which I have learned is the application of the template method in c++, its functions and importance. Further, I also understood how to declare a template for a function as well as for a class. Lastly, how to call the function is also described in this workshop. Talking about the difficulties which I faced in this workshop is to declare a template. Since, this was the first time for me to work with templates, it was hard for me to understand the logic of the already provided codes. However, using the notes I was able to understand the logic. Further following the instruction I wrote the templateFunctions.h and called those function in the main.cpp and completed this project. 

As far as the project is concern, in Milestone 4, I faced problem in indentation and these was some logic which was repeating. Hence, none of this could be considered as a major difficulty.
