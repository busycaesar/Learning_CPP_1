SUBMISSION : WORKSHOP 6 REFLECTION

In this workshop, the concepts which I have learned are listed as follows:

i.  Debugging:       This workshop had a lot of program which is divided into
                     several modules due to which in order to solve logical
                     error, I have to debug a lot.
ii. Shallow Copying: We had to create copy construtor and copy assignment
    Deep Copying     operator and while creating both of these we had to keep
                     at the back of mind that some variables are to be shallow
                     copied and some to be deep copied. This made me actually
                     understand the logic of both more as compared to the time
                     when I read the theory of both.

There was a time when I was not getting the desired output. On debugging, I came
to know that there was an issue in the function which had to extend the dynamic
memory. My mistake was that after creating the temperory variable which had the
extended memory, I use to assign that to the main data member of the class.
However, after assigning I use to delete the temperory variable. This use to cause
problem with data member of the class. I use to think that if both of those variables
are seperate then why deleting one variable is causing problem to the other one?
After a while I realized that while assigning from temp to Data Membery, I was
actually assigning the address; due to which there use to be the problem. This was
also the time when I actually understood the meaning and actual usage of shallow
copying and deep copying.
