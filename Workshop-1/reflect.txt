Submission  : Reflection: Workshop 1 Part 1

In this workshop, the first thing which I learned is that instead of writing the whole code in a single
module, it could be created in much more organized and easy to read way, by writing the code in
various modules and linking all the modules at the end. In order to divide the code, one should
identify all the similar functions, club them together and give the name to that module accordingly.
Each of the club will have one header file (structs, constants, function prototypes) and one
implimentation file (variables, function defination). However, over here the one thing which should be
taken into consideration is that when we link in the files at the end, there are very high chances that
some library or header file might get included twice because at the end the compiler is going to unite
all the modules. Therefore, it is very important to use #ifndef, #define and #endif in every header file
to rectify this possibility. Secondly writing the code in the same namespace lessens the possibility of
any error which might occur due to declaration of the variable of same name. 

(Why not to use 'using namespace' in header file?)
